        <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Simplay ("the App", "we", "us", or "our") is an IPTV application available on Apple TV and iOS. This Privacy Policy explains how and why we collect, store, use, disclose, and otherwise process personal data when you use the Simplay application and any related services (collectively, our "<strong>Services</strong>").</p>

        <p>If you have concerns about providing data to us or how it is used as described in this Privacy Policy, please see Section 7 (Control Over Your Information) and Section 8 (Your Privacy Rights), or contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@blv.sh">legal@blv.sh</a>.</p>

        <!-- 2. What Data We Collect -->

        <h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
        <p>When you use our Services, we may automatically collect and process the following types of data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Analytics &amp; Crash Data:</strong> We collect anonymous usage statistics and crash reports to improve app stability and performance. This may include your device model, operating system and version, app version, session duration, general usage patterns, crash logs, and diagnostic information such as loading times, latency, framerate, and other technical diagnostics.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Data:</strong> We may collect device-specific information such as your device type, operating system version, unique device identifiers (including Identifier for Vendor ("IDFV") on iOS and Apple TV), time zone, language settings, and screen resolution.</li>
            <li><strong>IP Address &amp; Approximate Location:</strong> We may collect your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, which may be used to determine your approximate geographic location (country or region level). This is used for analytics purposes and to comply with content licensing requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Viewing Activity:</strong> We collect information about your viewing history, playback preferences (such as audio and subtitle settings, video quality preferences, and equalizer settings), favorite channels, and content interaction patterns. This data is primarily stored locally on your device and is used to personalize and improve your experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information Collected from Third Parties</h3>
        <p>We may receive certain data from third parties in connection with your use of our Services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>App Marketplaces:</strong> When you download our application or make purchases through the Apple App Store, we receive information about your device, account (such as a transaction receipt), and payment confirmations. We do <strong>not</strong> receive access to your credit card, bank account, or other financial account data when you make purchases through the App Store. The data we receive from Apple is subject to their privacy policies and your settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Providers:</strong> If you connect third-party IPTV or streaming services within the App, we may receive limited information necessary to authenticate and deliver the content you have requested.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
        <p>Simplay does <strong>not</strong> collect the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name, email address, or other contact information (unless you voluntarily provide it to us, for example when contacting support)</li>
            <li>Credit card or banking information</li>

        </ul>

        <!-- 3. Purposes -->
        <h2 id="purposes">3. Purposes for Processing Your Data</h2>
        <p>We may use the data we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide, operate, and maintain our Services, including delivering IPTV content, managing your viewing preferences, and ensuring playback functionality across Apple TV and iOS;</li>

            <li>To process and verify in-app purchases and subscriptions, and to ensure that features and content you have paid for are properly activated;</li>

        <!-- 4. Subscriptions and Purchases -->
        <h2 id="subscriptions">4. Subscriptions and Purchases</h2>
        <p>Simplay offers the following types of in-app purchases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Auto-Renewable Subscriptions:</strong> We offer two subscription plans that provide access to premium features and content. Subscriptions are billed on a recurring basis (depending on the plan selected) and automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Consumable Purchase:</strong> We offer a one-time, non-consumable purchase that permanently unlocks specific features or content. This purchase is tied to your Apple ID and can be restored on any device signed in with the same Apple ID.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All purchases and subscriptions are processed exclusively through the Apple App Store. We do <strong>not</strong> process payments directly and do <strong>not</strong> have access to your payment method details.

            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your data may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you via a prominent notice within our Services of any change in ownership or uses of your personal data.</li>
            <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may disclose data about you to third parties when we have your explicit consent to do so.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Our Services may contain links to third-party websites, content providers, or services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, the privacy practices of any third-party services.

        <p>Our Services are not directed at children under the age of 13 (or the applicable age of consent in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under this age. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided personal data to us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@blv.sh">legal@blv.sh</a> so that we can take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's access to our Services.</p>

        <!-- 10. Security -->
        <h2 id="security">10. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We maintain physical, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include encryption of data in transit, secure cloud infrastructure, access controls, and regular security assessments.</p>
        <p>However, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We encourage you to take steps to protect your devices and accounts.</p>

        <!-- 11. Retention -->
